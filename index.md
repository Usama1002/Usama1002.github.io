## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Control Lab, School of EE, KAIST.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:** generative models, reinforcement learning, fairness, and transparency in machine learning
- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, object detection, and machine vision 
- **Control:** model predictive control, data-driven model learning
- **Robotics:** robot visualization, robot localization

## News

- **[Sept. 2022]** IEEE Access accepts our paper about learning fair and flexible data representations.
