## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Control Lab, School of EE, KAIST.

## Research Interests

- **Control:** model predictive control, data-driven model learning
- **Robotics:** robot visualization, robot localization
- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, object detection 
- **Machine Learning:** reinforcement learning, fairness and transparency in machine learning

## News

- **[Sept. 2022]** Our paper about leanring fair and flexible data representations is accepted to IEEE Access.
